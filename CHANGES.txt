=== 0.9.1 (WIP) ===

This version adds the missing font file, better multi-monitor and
multi-resolution handling, and a couple of functions to the query language.

UI:
- [fix] Add missing font file to repo
- [new] Store window size and position as fractions of screen size
- [new] Automatically adjust window size when dragged to different screen
- [chg] Glue view dividers to nearest border on window resize
- [fix] Correctly restore view dividers on start-up

Library:
- [new] Playlist column for tracks views
- [new] Query attribute #playlist
- [new] Query functions #min, #max, #avg, #if
- [fix] Export with position starts with position 01

Build:
- [chg] Add .opam file (thanks to kit-ty-kate)
- [chg] Remove obsolete auxiliary opam repo for Raylib 1.6.0
  (if you built 0.9.0 before, you may have to run
   `opam repo remove opam-raylib-1.6.0` and `opam update -u` once)
